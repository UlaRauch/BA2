Business interest in microservices is increasing since the microservice architecture brings a lightweight, independent, reuse-oriented, and fast service deployment approach that minimizes infrastructural risks. This approach is at an early stage of its development, and in view of this, it is important to understand the performance of its design patterns. In this article, we obtained performance results related to query response time, efficient hardware usage, hosting costs, and packet-loss rate, for three microservice design patterns practiced in the software industry.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate how can be provided security of an information system, which uses a microservice architecture. So, using of microservice architecture means that information system can be easily developed, deployed, and tested, but, on the other hand it means that it should be protected differently than the information system using monolith architecture. Firstly, a software architect should decide if each service should be protected separately or should be better to protect the system on the whole. Choosing the right way of protecting is very important, because, in some cases, protection of each service separately is not the best idea, as this could lead to code duplication. This means that, in case of necessity of changes a piece of code or fixing a bug it should be done everywhere this code appears. To avoid this, there are developed some services - so called gateways, which, also, very often have implemented the function of user/client authentication and authorization using protocol OAuth 2.0. Anyway, at each stage of development and implementation of a software product, it is necessary to solve many security related problems, and if it will not be done properly, then the company may incur enormous material losses or even may be closed.},

  abstract = {The microservices architecture (MSA) is a form of distributed systems architecture that has been widely adopted in large-scale software systems in recent years. As with other distributed system architectures, one of the challenges that MSA faces is establishing trust between the microservices, particularly in the context of open systems. The boundaries of open systems are unlimited and unknown, which means that they can be applied to any use case. Microservices can leave or join an open system arbitrarily, without restriction as to ownership or origin, and MSA systems can scale extensively. The organisation of microservices (in terms of the roles they play and the communication links they utilise) can also change in response to changes in the environment in which the system is situated. The management of trust within MSAs is of great importance as the concept of trust is critical to microservices communication, and the operation of an open MSA system is highly reliant on communication between these fine-grained microservices. Thus, a trust model should also be able to manage trust in an open environment. Current trust management solutions, however, are often domain-specific and many are not specifically tailored towards the open system model. This motivates research on trust management in the context of open MSA systems. In this paper, we examine existing microservices trust models, identify the limitations of these models in the context of the principles of open microservices systems, propose a set of qualities for open microservices trust models that emerge from these limitations, and assess selected microservices trust models using the proposed qualities.},

  abstract = {The microservices architectural style has been increasingly adopted in recent years due to its advantageous characteristics. While there exist design patterns for microservices that are theoretically beneficial for ensuring performance (and anti-patterns that should be avoided), they do not always lead to the expected impact. Some designs are solutions for achieving quality properties other than performance, and while they might be categorized as anti-patterns in theory, their influence on system performance can be minimal, depending on the context. Architects find it hard to reason about these trade-offs and the impact that design decisions will have on performance before implementing them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach that enables rapid evaluation of high-level architectural models by combining both static and dynamic analysis. The static analysis identifies the design anti-patterns that are known to hinder system performance and guides the architect in reasoning about these design decisions. The approach then generates source code for the system under study based on the architectural design model for a subsequent dynamic analysis to assess whether the statically detected anti-patterns do indeed have a negative effect on the performance of the analyzed system.},

This is a way of architecting software systems in which the services of a single application are decomposed then deployed and executed separately.

By developing a Proof of Concept (POC) of an Inventory Management System using MSA on top of Spring Framework, Spring Security Framework and OAuth2. we have conducted security tests over the POC using unit testing and manual testing techniques to examine if there are any vulnerabilities and we were able to show and confirm the effectiveness of the Spring Security Framework and OAuth2 in securing Spring-based APIs.},

Despite its increasing adoption, microservices might expose security concerns and issues that are distinct from those associated with monolithic designs. We propose Microusity, a tool that performs RESTful API testing on a specific type of microservice pattern called back end for front end (BFF). We design a novel approach to trace BFF requests using the port mapping between requests to BFF and the sub-requests sent to back-end microservices. Furthermore, our tool can pinpoint which of the back end service causing the internal server error, which may lead to unhandled errors or vulnerabilities. Microusity provides an error report and a graph visualization that reveal the source of the error and supports developers in comprehension and debugging of the errors. The evaluation of eight software practitioners shows that Microusity and its security test reports are useful for investigating and understanding problems in BFF systems. The prototype tool and the video demo of the tool can be found at https://github.com/MUICT-SERU/MICROUSITY.},
